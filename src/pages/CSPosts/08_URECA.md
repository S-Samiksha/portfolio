## Project Abstract

Trusted Execution Environments such as the Intel Software Guard Extensions(SGX) and the AMD Memory Encryption Technology enables sensitive code to run on a higher security level than that of the operating system. Intel SGX creates enclave separated from the operating system and hypervisor. This protects the codes running in the enclaves. There are many attacks that have been identified to compromise the security of the enclaves such as cache attacks and microarchitectural data sampling. Hence, it is imperative to test whether these enclaves are vulnerable to the reported attacks. The objective of this report is to build a repository of low-level attacks that could be used to design larger and more severe attacks. Additionally, this report aims to automate these low-level attacks. In this report, cache attacks and microarchitectural data sampling was the focus. As such, vulnerabilities of new or updated Intel SGX machines and the enclaves created can be tested.

## Acknowledgement

I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to Prof Anupam Chattopadhyay for his relentless support and guidance throughout each step of this URECA project. His invaluable advice has not only helped me become more knowledgeable in this research area but become a better researcher as well.

I would also like to thank the Hardware & Embedded Systems Lab (HESL) for providing the equipment needed for my research.

I would like to acknowledge the funding support from Nanyang Technological University â€“ URECA Undergraduate Research Programme for this research project.

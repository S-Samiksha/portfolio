## Project Overview

GitHub Codes are Private.

## Project Involvement

Constructed an image recognition model using the YOLO Object Detection Model to detect letters and numbers using Image Augmentation to raise variability and increase accuracy in various situations such as dim-lit areas and rotated

Built code to allow communications between 4 interfaces such as laptop and Android using multi-programming in Python3 onboard Raspberry Pi 4

The robot successfully traversed a maze and recognized images correctly on the obstacles.

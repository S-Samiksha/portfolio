## Reflections

I took up this project as an additional module. Made so many mistakes but learnt a lot too!

Probably the steepest learning curve I encountered since this leaned more into hardware. But really proud of this project as it got me my first internship in cybersecurity and laid a massive foundation for my interest in cybersecurity

## Project Overview

- Examined vulnerabilities in Intel SGX, AMD SME, and AMD SEV
- Analysed attacks such as Controlled-Cache Attacks, Meltdown and Spectre
- Replicated attacks in C++, created a repository of low-level attacks, and formulated an automated regression testing using shell scripting for future testing of new Intel SGX or similar machines

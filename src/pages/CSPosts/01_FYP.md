## Project Requirements

1. Build a Reputation Mechanism
2. Simulate it on Python
3. Code the final reputation mechanism in Solidity
4. Deploy the Smart Contract (Private Testnet is used)
5. Build FrontEnd using NextJS for final presentation

## Overview

In recent years, e-commerce platforms have risen. An important feature in these platforms is the ratings or reviews given to the products sold by the sellers on these platforms. Many buyers rely on these ratings or reviews to make informed decisions on whether to purchase the product. This underscores the importance of online reviews in e-commerce platforms. However, these rating scores are susceptible to adversarial threats.

Since majority of these platforms having centralized systems, a compromise in the centralized system could easily allow attackers to manipulate reviews and ratings. Blockchain offers a platform where the contracts are enforced by code. Once these contracts have been deployed into the blockchain, it is immutable by any party. Hence, preventing any manipulation or tampering of the code or the state of the contract. This is a solution to a centralized system
which could be compromised easily.

This project focuses on building a decentralized reputation system to compute reputation scores and the productâ€™s review scores. It aims to build a mechanism to prevent spam attacks, manipulation by adversaries, and any collusion attacks. It aims to build a system that incentivizes honest behaviour from the buyers such that they leave credible reviews. Furthermore, this project aims to create a mechanism that will allow maximum flexibility for e-commerce sites. This would allow e-commerce sites to choose how tolerant they want to be against adversarial attacks.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to Dr Liu Siyuan for her continuous support and guidance during this FYP project. Her invaluable advice has not only helped me become more knowledgeable in designing the reputation mechanism and blockchain but also become a better developer.

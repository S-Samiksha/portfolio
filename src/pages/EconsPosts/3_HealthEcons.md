## Project Overview

This project delves into the relationship between foreign aid as measured by external health expenditure (EXT) and direct foreign transfer (DFT) in developing countries. This study used both variables and their lags. EXT is measured as the foreign health aid received by a country as a percentage of current health expenditure of that specific country. DFT is the direct foreign transfer received by a country in million USD. This paper found that different models yield different results on whether foreign aid correlates with infant mortality.

This project also explored the use of three mediation channels namely number of HIV treatments, the percentage of low birth weight and Hepatitis vaccine rates to sieve out the direct and indirect correlation between foreign aid and infant mortality. Results obtained where mixed depending on the measurement used for foreign aid. The basic models showed foreign aid could be useful in affecting infant mortality, however, after mediating for the three channels, results suggest otherwise.

## Summary

In conclusion, this report has done three different models to investigate whether foreign aid correlates negatively with infant mortality via three mediator variables, namely Number of HIV Treatments, Hepatitis Vaccine Rate and Percentage of Low Birth Weight. This project shows that the hypothesis is correct to a certain extent. 1-Period lagged DFT does negatively correlate with infant mortality in the first difference model, but this correlation is no longer seen in either mediation models.

It is also discovered that percentage low birth weight is negatively correlated with DFT and EXT both lagged and contemporaneous in the SEM model and only negatively correlated with DFT
contemporaneous in the basic mediation model. The number of HIV treatments is positively correlated with 1-period lagged EXT and 1-period lagged DFT in the basic mediation model and only 1-period lagged DFT in the SEM model.

Such differences could be attributed to the type of models used or due to the lack of data. It can also suggest that different mediator variables are affected different from the time when foreign aid was injected into the country.

## Essay Overview

Submitted to London School of Economics, Summer School 2023. (Grade A)

## Introduction

For many years, elections are held to ensure the accountability of politicians. Political accountability means that politicians behave honestly and implement public policies beneficial to voters that elected them to office. It is used as a feature to evaluate the performance of the election. The higher the accountability achieved, the better the election has performed.

While elections serve to hold politicians accountable, they are not entirely effective. This essay shall explain how elections uphold accountability through selection and incentive. Then, it shall discuss the factors that influence the level of accountability achieved in an election. These factors include different types of electoral systems, voter behaviours and media influence.

## Theoretical Framework

Elections can be considered as a game in which voters have preferences over alternatives (candidates). There exists a rule for aggregating these voter preferences into a single outcome. The game results in selecting the most competent candidate and incentivizing the candidate to put in the effort to pass public policies favourable to the voters.

In this game proposed by Besley (2006), there exist two players – the incumbent and the challenger. The game lasts for two periods in which the incumbent passes a policy. Politicians serve a maximum of two terms and the game terminates after the second round. The voter observes their payoffs and decides whom to elect. The new incumbent will then pass a policy in the second round.

The politician is fully aware of his competence level, but the voter is not. Additionally, putting in effort can offset a lower level of competence of the politician. The politicians’ payoff is the rent received when they are elected minus the effort they put in. The voter only observes the payoff they receive when the policies are passed. The voter can either always retain the incumbent or if the incumbent has provided a certain payoff.

When the voter decides to always retain the incumbent, there is no incentive for politicians to put in effort and the payoff reveals the competence of the politicians. However, as the payoff required to re-elect the incumbent increases, the voter loses the ability to distinguish between the types of politicians. This is because less competent politicians need to put in more effort to achieve the higher payoff for voters, making less competent politicians indistinguishable
from a higher competent politician that puts in lower effort.

This game proves that elections can hold the politician accountable by either selecting a competent politician or incentivizing the less competent politician to work harder to achieve the desired payoff for the voter. However, a major flaw in this game is that it has no incentive for any type of politician to act for the benefit of society in the second and final round.

Additionally, voter behaviours can alter the extent to which selection and incentives occur in the game. For selection and incentive to work, voters must actively observe their payoffs to make decisions. This means that the voters need complete information on what policies are passed, the outcomes of such policies, the current state of the country etcetera.

According to Downs (1957), a rational voter can become well-informed for four reasons. Firstly, having information itself can provide the voter utility. Secondly, in a very close election, the voter can potentially influence the outcome should they be well informed. Thirdly, the voter could use the information to sway other voters. Finally, if voters act as a lobbyist, information can help to influence government policies. However, Downs argues that since one person or a group of people alone cannot alter the result of an election, there is no reason for a voter to be well-informed. This is known as rational ignorance. Hence, if the voters are not informed of their payoffs, they may not be able to play the simple agency model correctly.

Increasing the access and supply of information could help increase voter turnout and participation (Larcinese, 2007). However, the quantity and type of information can create asymmetric information through adverse selection and moral hazard. Voters may no longer be able to credibly tell if the politician is competent and acting in the voter’s interest. As such, what the voters perceive their payoff to be may not be the true payoff that they are receiving.

Moreover, it can be argued that the electoral system itself can affect accountability. Electoral systems aim to generate accountability and representativeness. However, these two cannot be achieved at the same time. Representativeness means that the preferences of the voters are accurately mirrored in the office.

Firstly, proportional systems have more representativeness but, as a result, less accountability than majoritarian systems. Coalitions will be created to form the government in the proportional system. Consequently, voters do not know which politicians were responsible for the policies passed. They are not informed and cannot hold politicians accountable by voting the bad incumbents out. On the contrary, majoritarian systems tend to only allow for two main parties (Duverger, 1954) allowing voters to know which party is responsible for the policies and the payoffs they are observing. As such, voters are more informed and can select good incumbents by re-electing them in the second round.

## Empirical Evidence and Evaluation

Here, empirical evidence is used to explain the theoretical framework discussed in Section 2.

Galasso & Nannicini (2009) found evidence to support the idea of selection. They used data from 1994 to 2001 at the district level for elections to the Italian House and Senate. The level of competence using the number of years of education, market income previously earned and past experience in local governments was used as an indicator of competence. They discovered that more competent politicians run in more competitive districts. Generally, performance levels were higher in the contestable districts. By comparing politicians who switched from competitive to safe districts due to the national coalition bargaining, they found out that the improved performance comes mainly from selection. This study is ingenious in that it exploited the coalition bargaining to prove selection. However, performance was measured using the rate of absenteeism. The lack of absenteeism does not translate into being a good politician. How a politician decides to spend his time in parliament affects the quality of policies passed and the efficiency of public spending. A politician could be present in parliament but may not necessarily make proper use of his time.

Ferraz & Finan, (2010) showed incentives exist to ensure accountability by using corruption audit reports in Brazil. By monitoring mayors in their first and second terms, they discovered that second-term mayors were 4% more corrupt than first-term mayors. This shows that there is a lower incentive for incumbents to be accountable in their second and final term in office. Additionally, they discovered that mayors without re-election incentives misappropriate 27 percent more resources than those with such incentives. These effects were more striking in areas with lower information access and a lower likelihood of punishment. This paper hence supports two key ideas – incentives as a dimension in accountability and the necessity of
information access.

In this paper, it is recognized that there are heterogenous reactions from voters concerning corruption. Voters may still elect corrupt politicians due to the provision of certain goods and services or based on ideological and/or ethnic preferences. Additionally, they recognize that not all forms of misconduct may be visible to the voters.

This voting behaviour in Brazil was analysed in detail by Figueiredo, Hidalgo, & Kasahara (2022). A field and survey experiment was conducted during the Brazil mayoral runoff election in 2008. They designed two fliers containing credible information detailing corruption allegations, one for each candidate.

Voters were surveyed a week after the election. It was discovered that despite credible information being available, voters would behave heterogeneously depending on the importance they place on corruption and their support of a particular party. Furthermore, political cleavage can cause certain corrupt politicians to be punished more than others.

In the simple agency game, voters act purely based on their payoffs which are determined solely by the politician’s competence and effort. However, voters’ political preferences and their responses to information provided, are not considered in this game. Hence, incumbents may no longer be held fully accountable.

Given that information plays a crucial role in holding accountability, media influence needs to be scrutinized. Media will naturally change the access, supply and type of information that voters have. One flaw in the above paper is not accounting for the latest technological disruptions that have occurred. Recently, there is a boom in social media and fake news, which can skew the way voters make decisions.

A model was set up by Li, Raiha, & Shotts (2022) to show the effects between the probability of malicious alternative media and the cost of efforts politicians need to put in to be re-elected. It was discovered that political effort can be reduced when alternative media is malicious and spreads false accusations. Knowing that alternative media is not credible, voters ignore it and turn to mainstream media. However, autocrats may use propaganda to depict them as competent politicians and win the re-election. This reduces the amount of effort politicians are incentivized to put in. This study only provided a model and had no empirical evidence to support the claims. However, it does provide insight into emerging technological factors that can affect accountability.

Finally, evidence on how the different electoral systems can affect accountability is provided by Breunig, Grossman, & Hänni (2022). They scrutinized the proportional system and majoritarian systems within a single country, Germany. This paper used an interesting approach because Germany uses the mixed-member proportional system. It was found that politicians elected under the majoritarian rule will respond twice as likely compared to those elected under the proportional system. This shows that majoritarian systems do have more
accountability than proportional systems.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, elections do uphold accountability albeit to a limited extent. Factors such as the electoral system, voter behaviour and media influence affect the amount of accountability that can be achieved. Needless to say, elections are essential to maintain democracy and some degree of accountability. Otherwise, without elections, there may simply be no accountability at all!

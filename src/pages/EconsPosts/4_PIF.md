## Project Overview

This was Part of a wider project under a professor in the NTU Economics department who works with South East Asian Nations, John Hopkins and other organizations to determine sugar/sodium tax in these nations.

For this project, I used multiprogramming to automate and speed up the calculations of Potential Impact Factor (PIF). PIFs are usually calculated based on multiple demographic factors like age, gender and income quintiles.

Each combination of demographic factors have to be simulated 1000 times. Simulations require sampling from variables like BMI and changes to consumption of sugar over a normal distribution.

In total this amounts to 18 Million Simulations.

With multi-programming, this is shorted to 10min from 1.5 of Manual Man Days.
